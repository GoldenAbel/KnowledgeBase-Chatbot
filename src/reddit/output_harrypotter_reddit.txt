Oh are you talking about the last book I know that other muggle horns went to the Room of Requirement so maybe he did as well.
Nice Hiddleston would bring a good alternate take on Snape.
My parents didnt read to me once I learned to read myself I wouldnt let them I read all sorts of books that werent age appropriate and things I didnt understand were forgotten until future rereads when I was old enough to understand A librarian telling me I.
From what Ive read I dont think you can apparate anyone but yourself This is probably a safe measure so that someone cant suddenly grab you when you decide to apparate.
Yes Ive read the books many time Its baffling to me as to why he didnt read them and the excuse he gave was rather lame not wanting to be disappointed or something Nonetheless I liked him as Dumbledore Harris seemed too slow and not as wise as he should be where as Gambon was quick and decisive.
I do like how harry never gives her anything for her birthday lol.
True At first I didnt like how she was cast but shes grown on me.
It might be a personal problem but its more of a being pestered about having kids thing I think.
This is beautiful I want more Now I regret not keeping my bad fanfic for the sake of cringing at it in the future.
I actually kind of liked the part about Lavender dying Not because it was Lavender in particular but because seeing the death of one of their schoolmates who we see throughout the movies made it look all the more real Prior to this scene we dont actually see any blatant deaths that this particular battle had caused and seeing Lavender really brought down the fact that this was really serious.
I go to school in PDX during the school year.
They exist for lots of children celebs The first one I recall was for the Olsen twins and I saw it several years before they hit 18 in 2004.
and Scrimgeour at the very beginning.
I dont think Sirius would be afraid of Azkaban As he says in PoA he wasnt afraid of it He used that to escape and track down Pettigrew I think it would rather be something like his parents and family returned and he having no place to hide or maybe dragons I dunno.
Thats gorgeous Expecto updates.
Dumbledores death didnt bother me it was his funeral amp when Fawkes was flying overhead That was hard.
Im not super okay with it but at least he told them that they were illegal and it was wrong to do them I liken it to showing kids guns but explaining how they can only be used for bad How am I over exaggerating Snape definitely abused and tormented Umbridge is the only other teacher who was as bad as him Even Lockhart wasnt that bad until he tried to wipe Rons mind Who else was there that did bad things.
Thanks Ill look into it.
For some reason I found myself reading a passage Goblet of Fire out and voicing Neville the way he is in Potter Puppet Pals Pumpkin Nevilles best line is My gwandmuvver would dever abwoove.
Yeah I think as a publicschooled American this idea is just lost on me Id be heartbroken to not see my mum and dad every night.
Theyre going to stretch this into three films How many rights did She sell.
This is very common in acting and theatre.
I agree Dumbledore said that he thought that the brothers were just great wizards so anything they could do another wizard could do or undo We see this during the graveyard scene where the wands act like the stone.
I went around the shop for a few mins with them between my fingers scratching my supervisor.
Yeah probably Its possible that Voldemort intentionally put 17th of his soul into each horcrux but we have no way of knowing whether he did or if thats even possible My assumption was always that he put some small amount of his soul in each one but that the majority of it was still in himselflike chipping small pieces off of a rock or something This still makes sense to me as the horcruxes are obviously less powerful than voldemort himselfthey need to work through someone else rather than being autonomous human beings.
The Malfoys are experts at earning the trust of people that shouldnt trust them Lucius was a Death Eater who was on the Board of Governors of Hogwarts.
Yeah the way I see it the Slytherin immediately thought how he could use the knife to get ahead or get something with it.
Do you mean by the Slytherin line.
This one is my favorite as well but for different reasons For me its just about living life and taking risks While Im no introvert I never took risks Ive been getting a lot better and this is my favorite quote I even have it written on the whiteboard on the inside of my front door that way I see it every time I leave the house.
Ive actually never heard that expression before I listened to a comedian on Sirius Radio and he was talking about drinking water  Water That stuff sinks Battleships It always amused me because I dislike drinking water so its become one of my favorite excuses.
Well As much as this pains me Tom Felton.
This is good Thanks for linking.
That sounds really interesting actually.
No it wasnt Look at the usernames of the people talking to you.
Well Harry threw away the wand and stone but I can see your point.
How did you know that o.
I cry every single time.
Pedantry warning Fungi do breed after a fashion They certainly dont spontaneously generate.
That would be awesome.
I am pretty sure that he took exams in his first year.
Ive spent more time thinking about this than Im proud to admit and I have yet to come to any reasonable conclusion.
1010 would read.
I felt like the whole arguing all the time insulting each other and making your supposed crush cry is actually more cliche than the mainguymain girl cliche More over the books were so powerful for our generation that I think giving validity to an emotionally abusive relationship set up our generation for pain in the future The whole they argue like an old married couple is not a sign of sexual tension it is a sign that they disagree on many vital aspects of life This is why I feel like Ron and Hermione are not on the same wavelength at all Perhaps they might have dated but they also would have broken up as Bakuwoman said Instead I feel like Harry and Hermione are much more in sync plus you get the impression throughout the series that the respect and care for each other Yes maybe they wouldnt date during Hogwarts but I think that as they matured they especially Hermione who did not have a stunted emotional development would come to realize that there are more important things then peer pressure.
I think its more this It wasnt that people wouldnt find the room but think about how you get into this particular part of it you need a place to hide something so once you are in you see rows and rows and rows of just a bunch of stuff Youre not going to be paying attention to random tiaras among the piles of things when your only focus is hiding whatever it is you have to hide.
Yeah right What is this 2013 or something.
On the 27th of April the official Pottermore Twitter account updated their profile to say Were currently working on Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets and its looking great A link to the Insider page was also provided which revealed that there will be an announcement in a few weeks with further information Seeing as it is has been two weeks since it was Tweeted I am guessing that we will be provided with a projected due date in the coming week I think Pottermore gets a lot more slack than it deserves To me its an excellent platform for JKR to share new information and tidbits with the public at no cost to us The lengthy wait for CoS will probably be worth it We have to keep in mind that these are the shortest of the books as well its going to take them a lot longer to produce the larger novels such as OotP.
Audible sigh I can see we have hit an impasse I will bow out of this because I dont like banging my head against brick walls.
who says they do or dont we dont really see that much of transfiguring to say either way.
I agree that Harrys behavior in the 5th book pissed me off and caused me to roll my eyes more than once but I think it was important in 1 making Harry a believable teenager since all teenagers go through their angst phase in some way at one point or another and 2 giving him flaws He has flaws throughout the series but one of the best things about the Harry Potter series and what makes for good writing is.
I got the plain black symbol fairly large in my back and after tip it was 120.
