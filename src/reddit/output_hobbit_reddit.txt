Yes I agree.
Maybe so The difference is hardly noticeable Almost no difference seems a little stupid to put that in a review.
Isnt Gandalf trapped He already told Radagast to tell the rest.
Isnt it Dain or Thranduil that does that in the book I know Thranduil gives Orchrist back.
gtHowever I dont think you can claim Jackson amp co didnt realize what they were doing Still I see your point Im actually trying to give them the benefit of the doubt  that it was an honest mistake Because otherwise they did it on purpose to F with the heads of everyone in the northern hemisphere  and Id really rather NOT think that.
I also had to doublecheck OP xpost this to rmylittlepony for more karma.
Its probably because the movie will begin and end on Frodo reading Bilbos old diary We saw this book in LotR Bilbo was writing his adventures in it and he asked Frodo to finish the book with his own adventures ie the book is an inuniverse The HobbitThe Lord of the Rings.
Yeah rewatch the golden dwarf statue scene and stsand by your words you assbirth.
Exactly You have to look at the book from the perspective of someone who has never read Tolkien How do you get someone like that invested in this story and film How do you get them to care about their adventure How do you emphasize that this journey.
gt The three movies are setting the stage for LoTR as the prequels Thats my biggest complaint about it actually The Hobbit is my favorite book of all time It is an incredibly influential childrens novel It stands on its own and isnt the prequel to anything In fact the LotR trilogy is the SEQUEL to The Hobbit It bothers me to see it being used as a prop for the trilogy rather than a story in its own right.
I wouldnt call it power but it is a side effect at least in this case You cant deny that Gollum is a cannibal Instead of living with your fellow creatures as the Hobbits do you instead live OFF of other creatures as Sauron does.
Yeah When you grow up youll understand to do the baby voice on children so their jimmies arent so rustled.
Im pretty sure they just tossed him onto the table and there happened to be a bowl of walnuts there Not much time to clear space when your buddy is dying of a morgul wound.
Especially my penis Is that weird or something.
I see what you mean Well I dont think any Middle Earth movie will ever win Best Picture again unless its way down the line These Hobbit movies just have the cornball feeling to me the we def made it 3 movies so wed make more money Its the exact opposite of the LOTR trilogy fans were begging for more movies but here I think less would have been better There were like 45 minutes of this movie devoted to Orlando Bloom fighting the 2nd bigbadmadeupwhiteorc Bleh smacks of dat cheese.
They dont exist though.
I believe hes only in the extended I just watched it the other day There are definitely some new scenes that add to the quality of the story line.
gt Do you want other songs that are like that one Yes.
I feel like thats kind of the point of The Shire though.
gt You seem to be conflating attention to detail with the integrity of the story I didnt do a particularly good job explaining this but I do not think effort  story integrity The biggest thing I mean to point out is that they paid tons of attention to the book when creating the script self reportedly which shows desire to keep the storys integrity But regardless I think paying attention and keeping integrity with things like creating mail by hand and the work that they put into showing distinctions between cultures shows their desire to keep to the storys integrity By paying attention to the detail within the story they are doing something to give their movie sourcebased integrity As for characters speaking other characters lines I feel like I kind of remember this happening in the films but as I said in my.
Hey you are entitled to your opinion of the film I on the other hand dont think Thorin was made a lead because of Hollywood cynicism The Hobbit films are meant to go together with the LOTR films LOTR was about the race of men These films were about
